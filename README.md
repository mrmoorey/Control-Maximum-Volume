# Control-Maximum-Volume
Set the volume of a speaker when it goes above a configured level. SmartThings SmartApp.
Add the parent and child to your environment and publish.
Choose the speaker, set the max volume, then set the volume you want it reduced to.
I do not account for setting max volume so that the controlled volume is louder. That's your choice.
It can be run at different intervals and modes, but it ideally runs on any level event from the device.

Feedback is welcome.

Some aspects of the code are "borrowed" from the Speaker Control SmartApp.
